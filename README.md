# NextBot Running Module

Adds **4** new actions, `scared`, that will play whenever your player, realistically should be scared of a NextBot. `scared-teammate-down`, that will player whenever your player is nearby when somebody has died. `scared-shot`, whenever your player shoots something they're scared of, and `scared-hear-trigger`, whenever something you're scared of makes a noise.
Implemented module-side, so this does nothing but play that module.
